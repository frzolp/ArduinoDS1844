DS1844 - (Barely) a library for controlling the Dallas Semiconductor/Maxim IC DS1844,
which is a quad digital potentiometer.

(From the product page at http://www.maxim-ic.com/datasheet/index.mvp/id/2803)
- Four 64-position potentiometers
- Operates on 2.7V to 5.5V
- Offers a 5-wire serial interface or 2-wire addressable interface
- Comes in 10Kohm, 50Kohm, and 100Kohm versions

This Arduino library provides some shortcuts when working with this chip.
It makes a couple assumptions:
	1.) You have the PS pin connected to GND because...
	2.) You're using the 5-wire serial interface

I hacked this together in about a half hour, so the code is messy but functional. Don't worry,
I'll be cleaning it up soon enough.
